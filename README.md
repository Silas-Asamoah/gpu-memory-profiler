# gpu-memory-profiler

A simple tool to profile the memory usage of your GPU over time.

This profiler is designed to work with deep learning frameworks like Pytorch and Tensorflow. It provides real-time tracking and profiling of GPU memory usage during the execution of your deep learning models. This can be particularly useful for identifying memory leaks or inefficiencies in your model's memory usage. The tool provides a detailed breakdown of memory usage by layer, allowing you to pinpoint exactly where in your model the most memory is being used. This can help you optimize your model for better performance and efficiency.

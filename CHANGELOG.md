# Changelog

All notable changes to GPU Memory Profiler will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Launch QA scenario modules under `examples/scenarios/` for CPU telemetry, MPS telemetry, OOM flight recorder coverage, and TensorFlow end-to-end telemetry/diagnose checks.
- Capability matrix orchestrator (`python -m examples.cli.capability_matrix`) with smoke/full modes, target selection (`auto|cpu|mps|both`), OOM mode controls, and machine-readable reports.
- Scenario smoke tests (`tests/test_examples_scenarios.py`) and updated TUI pilot coverage for launch quick actions.
- Updated TUI snapshot baselines for intentional CLI & Actions tab changes.

### Changed

- Drop support for Python 3.8 and 3.9; minimum supported runtime is now Python 3.10.
- Migration note: users on Python 3.8/3.9 should upgrade to Python 3.10+ or pin `gpu-memory-profiler<0.2.0`.
- Refresh docs/API examples to match current CLI and profiler behavior.
- Publish a versioned compatibility matrix for v0.2 and link it from top-level docs.
- Stabilize benchmark harness defaults (`--iterations 200`) and align benchmark/testing documentation to this baseline.
- Expand TUI CLI/Playbook guidance and quick actions to highlight diagnose, OOM scenario, and capability matrix workflows.
- Refresh release-facing docs (`README`, examples guides, `RELEASE_CHECKLIST`, `PROJECT_STATUS`) for v0.2 launch readiness.

### Deprecated

- [Future deprecations will be listed here]

### Removed

- [Future removals will be listed here]

### Fixed

- Remove stale docs references to unsupported CLI options and non-existent profiler APIs.
- Fix `examples.basic.tensorflow_demo` constructor/API mismatch so the demo runs against the current TensorFlow profiler implementation.

### Security

- [Future security fixes will be listed here]
